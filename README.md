# Week 24 Project — SpendingsTracker Spring App

## Context
I lost a bet with a friend and he challenged me that for the next 52 weeks, during weekends I need to create from scratch a new project.

For this week, we decided to build a data visualization tool to track monthly expenses. I'm allowed to work on it only Sunday.

## The rules are the following:
*   Each Friday night, me and him will talk about what project I need to do.
*   Mostly he will decide for me, but I’m allowed to suggest and do my own ideas if he agrees on them.
*   Once the project is decided, he will tell me if I’m allowed to work Saturday and Sunday, or only Sunday.
(Surely this won’t backfire at some point by underestimating a project, right? 😅)

## About the project
SpendingsTracker is a Spring Boot application designed to turn raw transaction data into actionable visual insights. It parses financial data from a local CSV source and generates a real-time dashboard.

*   **Total Overview:** Instantly see the sum of all expenses for the month.
*   **Category Breakdown:** A Doughnut chart showing which sectors (Housing, Groceries, Entertainment, etc.) are consuming the budget.
*   **Daily Trends:** A Bar chart mapping out spending habits day-by-day to identify peak spending periods.

### How to run:
1.  Compile and run the Spring Boot application.
2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
